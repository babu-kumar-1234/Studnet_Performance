Student Performance using Linear regression to predict the which feature is best of our target variable. 

Linear Regression Analysis
This repository contains the results of a linear regression analysis between various features and the Performance Index. The R2 scores for each feature are as follows:

- Previous Scores: High R2 scores (0.8374 on training data and 0.8379 on testing data) indicate a strong linear relationship with Performance Index.
- Hours Studied: Moderate R2 scores (0.1406 on training data and 0.1357 on testing data) suggest a weaker relationship.
- Other features: Sample Question Papers Practiced, Sleep Hours, and Extracurricular Activities have very low R2 scores, indicating weak relationships with Performance Index.

These results suggest that Previous Scores is a strong predictor of Performance Index, while other features may require further analysis or feature engineering to improve their predictive power.

Key Takeaways
- Previous Scores is a strong predictor of Performance Index.
- Hours Studied has a moderate relationship with Performance Index.
- Other features have weak relationships with Performance Index.

Future Work
- Explore feature engineering techniques to improve the predictive power of other features.
- Investigate other machine learning models that may perform better on this data.
